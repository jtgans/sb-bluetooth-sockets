* sb-bluez

=sb-bluez= is an extension to the standard SBCL contrib package,
=sb-bsd-sockets= and implements BlueZ's RFCOMM and L2CAP sockets using the same
overloaded socket mechanism available to normal C programs. In addition, this
library provides a simplistic interface to the BlueZ SDP services to allow for
registration of servers, as well as the HCI and inquiry suites to allow for
remote device discovery.

To use this extension, load in =sb-bluez= using your favorite ASDF
implementation (please use Quicklisp -- you'll save yourself quite a bit of
headache).
